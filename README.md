## 🐧 Why Linux Matters in DevOps  
Linux is the backbone of DevOps because it powers most cloud servers, containers, and automation platforms. Its stability, performance, strong CLI tools, and scriptability make it ideal for building, deploying, and operating modern infrastructure.

---

## 🐙 Why GitHub Matters in DevOps  
GitHub acts as the collaboration and automation hub for DevOps teams, enabling source control, pull requests, CI/CD pipelines, code reviews, and integration with cloud-native workflows — all essential for reliable software delivery.

---

## 🐳 Why Docker Matters  
Docker standardizes environments by packaging applications and dependencies into portable containers, ensuring consistent deployments from local development to production across cloud and Kubernetes environments.

---

## ☸️ Why Kubernetes Matters  
Kubernetes automates deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications. Its self-healing, declarative model, and orchestration capabilities make it the core engine of cloud-native DevOps systems.

---

## 🌍 Why Terraform Matters  
Terraform enables Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC), allowing teams to define, version, provision, and manage cloud resources predictably and automatically across AWS, Azure, GCP, Kubernetes, and more.

---

## 🛠️ Why Jenkins Matters  
Jenkins powers CI/CD automation, enabling teams to build, test, and deploy applications consistently through pipelines-as-code and integrations with the entire DevOps toolchain.

---

## ☁️ Why AWS CLI Matters  
The AWS CLI provides programmatic control over AWS services, enabling engineers to automate provisioning, configure IAM, deploy resources, fetch logs, and manage cloud infrastructure directly from the command line.

---

## 🏁 Conclusion  
These 100 commands form the operational backbone of modern DevOps engineering. By mastering them across Linux, Git, Docker, Kubernetes, Terraform, Jenkins, and AWS, you gain the hands-on capability to automate workflows, deploy applications, manage infrastructure, and troubleshoot systems with confidence.
