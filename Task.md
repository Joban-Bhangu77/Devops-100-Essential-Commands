# 📝 Project Task: DevOps 100 Essential Commands  


---

## 📌 About This Project  
This project was created to compile the **Top 100 Essential Commands** that every Cloud & DevOps Engineer should master.  
It brings together the most commonly used commands across:

- Linux  
- Git  
- Docker  
- Kubernetes  
- Terraform  
- Jenkins  
- AWS CLI  

The goal is to provide a **central, practical, and hands-on reference** that engineers can use daily while working on automation, deployments, troubleshooting, and cloud infrastructure tasks.

## 🎯 Why This Project Was Created  
I created this project to:

- Strengthen my command-line fundamentals  
- Build a reliable reference for real-world DevOps work  
- Document the most important commands used in cloud environments  
- Improve my understanding of infrastructure automation  
- Create a GitHub resource that others can learn from  
- Build a solid foundation for DevOps interviews and professional growth  

This project represents a structured learning approach to mastering the tools and workflows behind modern Cloud & DevOps Engineering.

## ⚙️ How This Project Was Completed  
This project was built through a step-by-step breakdown of each DevOps tool.  
For every tool, I collected the most relevant commands and wrote:

- A short explanation of what the command does  
- A real-world DevOps use case  
- A clean copy-ready code block for fast practice  

All commands were researched, tested, and rewritten in a simplified, easy-to-understand format that can be used in daily engineering tasks.
